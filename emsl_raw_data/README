Some files:
    basis-file-map.txt  Map of *CURRENTLY PUBLISHED* basis set names to files

    onsite.txt     Text of the mapping (taken directly from the JS of the BSE website)
    published.txt  Similar to onsite.txt, but containing only those marked "published"

    create_map.py Used to split apart the info from onsite.txt and published.txt
                  and create basis-file-map.txt

    copy_file_and_deps.py Copies an XML file and its dependencies (references, components, etc) to
                          a destination directory


Subdirectories:
    The emsl-lib and contrib directories contain the raw xml data
    (taken directly from the EMSL data package)
